    "content": "# Prompt Engineering for Product Managers\n\nIn product management, the quality of your output is only as good as the clarity of your requirements. This principle applies as much to your engineering team as it does to generative AI. This lesson moves past basic \"ask a question\" interactions and introduces a professional framework designed for the complexity of the SaaS lifecycle.\n\n## The CTC Framework: Context, Task, Constraint\n\nTo move from generic AI responses to production-ready drafts, use the **CTC Framework**. This structure ensures the LLM understands not just what you want, but the strategic *why* behind it.\n\n### 1. Context: The \"Why\" and \"Who\"\nMost PMs fail by jumping straight to the request. Context provides the background: what is the company, who is the persona, and what stage of the product lifecycle are we in?\n*   **Bad Context:** \"I am a PM at a SaaS company.\"\n*   **Good Context:** \"I am a Senior PM at a B2B FinTech startup. We are building a mid-market expense management tool for CFOs who are currently using spreadsheets and find existing enterprise solutions too bloated.\"\n\n### 2. Task: The \"What\"\nBe specific about the artifact you need. Instead of \"write me something,\" use action verbs like \"draft,\" \"synthesize,\" \"prioritize,\" or \"critique.\"\n*   **Task Example:** \"Draft a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a new 'Single-Click Reimbursement' feature that integrates with Slack and Microsoft Teams.\"\n\n### 3. Constraint: The \"How\"\nConstraints define the boundaries. This is where you specify the format (Markdown, JSON, bullet points), the tone (professional, concise, user-centric), and what to *exclude*.\n*   **Constraint Example:** \"Use the following headers: Problem Statement, User Stories, and Success Metrics. Keep user stories in the 'As a [persona], I want [action], so that [value]' format. Do not include a competitive analysis section.\"\n\n---\n\n## Real-World SaaS Application: PRD Drafting\n\nLet’s apply CTC to a heavy-lift task: drafting a PRD from raw discovery notes.\n\n**The Integrated Prompt:**\n> **[Context]** I am a PM at a project management tool (similar to Asana). We are launching a 'Gantt Chart View' for our Pro tier users. Our users are project leads who struggle with visualizing long-term dependencies.\n> \n> **[Task]** Based on the context, draft a PRD. Focus specifically on the 'Dependency Management' logic.\n> \n> **[Constraint]** Length should be under 800 words. Format as a Markdown document. Include a section on edge cases, such as circular dependencies between tasks. Use a technical but accessible tone for an engineering audience.\n\n## Refining User Stories with Precision\n\nWhen refining user stories, the constraint part of CTC becomes critical for maintaining engineering standards. You can use the AI to stress-test your logic:\n\n*   **The Prompt:** \"I am refining user stories for our mobile login flow. **[Context]** Here is my draft: 'As a user, I want to log in so I can see my dashboard.' **[Task]** Rewrite this story to be more specific and include 'Acceptance Criteria.' **[Constraint]** Include criteria for biometric authentication (FaceID) and 'Forgot Password' recovery. Format the output as a table.\"\n\n---\n\n## Summary of Best Practices\n\n*   **Output Formatting:** Always ask for Markdown. It makes it easy to copy-paste directly into Jira, Notion, or Confluence.\n*   **Iteration:** Think of your first prompt as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). If the output is too wordy, add a constraint: \"Rewrite this to be 30% shorter.\"\n*   **Role Play:** Start your context with a persona: \"Act as a Principal Product Manager with 10 years of experience in API integrations.\"",
